# Native File System adapter (ponyfill)

> This is an in-browser file system that follows [native-file-system](https://wicg.github.io/native-file-system/) and supports storing and retrieving files from various backends.

### Adapters

This polyfill/ponyfill ships with 5 filesystem backends:

* `native`: Stores files the `Native Sandboxed` file storage
* `Sandbox`: Stores files into the Blinks `Sandboxed FileSystem` API.
* `IndexedDB`: Stores files into the browser's `IndexedDB` object database.
* `Memory`: Stores files in-memory. Thus, it is a temporary file store that clears when the user navigates away.
* `Cache storage`: Stores files in cache storage like a request/response a-like.

The api is designed in such a way that it can work with or without the ponyfill if you choose to remove or add this.<br>
It's not trying to interfear with the changing spec by using other properties that may conflict with the feature changes to the spec. A few none spec options are prefixed with a `_`

( The current minium supported browser I have choosen to support is the ones that can handle import/export )<br>
( Some parts are lazy loaded when needed )

### Using

```js
import {
  showDirectoryPicker,
  showOpenFilePicker,
  showSaveFilePicker,
  FileSystemDirectoryHandle,
  FileSystemFileHandle,
  FileSystemHandle,
  FileSystemWritableFileStream,
  getOriginPrivateDirectory
} from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jimmywarting/native-file-system-adapter/src/es6.js'


// the getOriginPrivateDirectory is a legacy name that
// native filesystem added, have not bother to change it

getOriginPrivateDirectory() // same as calling navigator.storage.getDirectory()
// Blink's good old sandboxed file system API, can choose between persistent and temporary 
getOriginPrivateDirectory(import('../src/adapters/sandbox.js'))
getOriginPrivateDirectory(import('../src/adapters/memory.js'))
getOriginPrivateDirectory(import('../src/adapters/indexeddb.js'))
getOriginPrivateDirectory(import('../src/adapters/cache.js'))
getOriginPrivateDirectory(import('../src/adapters/node.js'), './starting-path')

// The polyfilled (file input) version will turn into a memory adapter
// You will have readwrite permission on the memory adapter,
// you might want to transfer (copy) the handle to another adapter
showOpenFilePicker({_preferPolyfill: boolean, ...sameOpts}).then(fileHandle => {})
showDirectoryPicker({_preferPolyfill: boolean, ...sameOpts}).then(directoryHandle => {})

// Supports drag and drop also
ondrop = evt => {
  evt.preventDefault()
  getOriginPrivateDirectory(evt.dataTransfer).then(directoryHandle => {
    // This is kind of a hybrid memory & sandboxed (Entry api) adapter
    // it works together with old Entry API rather then transferring all of it to a memory adapter 
    // This would allow you to monitor file changes by calling getFile()
    // and compare the last modified date or file size
    // You will have read access but, requesting write permission will reject.
  })
}

// request user to select a file
const fileHandle = await showOpenFilePicker({
  types: [], // default
  multiple: false, // default
  excludeAcceptAllOption: false, // default
  _preferPolyfill: false // default
})

// returns a File Instance
const file = await fileHandle.getFile()

// copy the file over to a another adapter
const rootHandle = await getOriginPrivateDirectory() // same as navigator.store.getDirectory()
const fileHandle = await rootHandle.getFileHandle(file.name, { create: true })
await fileHandle.write(file)

// save/download a file
const fileHandle = await showSaveFilePicker({
  _preferPolyfill: false,
  suggestedName: 'Untitled.png',
  types: [
    { accept: { "image/png": [ "png" ] } },
    { accept: { "image/jpg": [ "jpg" ] } },
    { accept: { "image/webp": [ "webp" ] } }
  ],
  excludeAcceptAllOption: false // default
})

// Look at what extension they chosed
const extensionChosen = fileHandle.name.split('.').pop()

const blob = {
  jpg: generateCanvasBlob({ type: 'blob', format: 'jpg' }),
  png: generateCanvasBlob({ type: 'blob', format: 'png' }),
  webp: generateCanvasBlob({ type: 'blob', format: 'webp' })
}[extensionChosen]

await blob.stream().pipeTo(fileHandle.getWriter())
// or 
var writer = fileHandle.getWriter()
writer.write(blob)
writer.close()
```

PS: storing a file handle in IndexedDB or sharing it with postMessage isn't currently possible unless you use native.
Will get to it at some point in the feature

### A note when downloading with the polyfilled version

Saving/downloading a file borrowing some of ideas from [StreamSaver.js](https://github.com/jimmywarting/StreamSaver.js).
The difference is:
 - Using service worker is optional choice with this adapter. ü§∑‚Äç
 - It dose not rely on some man-in-the-middle or external hosted service worker.
 - If you want to stream large data to the disk directly instead of taking up much RAM you need to set up a service worker yourself.<br>(note that it requires https - but again worker is optional)
 - You don't have to handle web-streams-polyfills it's lazy loaded when needed when you need that writable stream. üò¥

to set up a service worker you have to basically copy [the example](https://github.com/jimmywarting/native-file-system-adapter/tree/master/example/sw.js) and register it:

```js
navigator.serviceWorker.register('sw.js')
```

Without service worker you are going to write all data to the memory and download it once it closes.

Seeking and truncating won't do anything. You should be writing all data in sequental order when using the polyfilled version.

-----

If you have chosen to `open-directory` when the polyfilled version is in use (`input[webkitdirectory]`)
than you can't get any write access to it. So unless you are using chanary with experimental flags or enabled the [Origin Trials](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/OriginTrials/blob/gh-pages/developer-guide.md) for beta testing on your origin, then you better use `save-file` instead to be safe. It's also possible to query/request permission.

### Testing

start up a server and open `/examples/test.html` in your browser.
